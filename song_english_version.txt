"In the forest, the Christmas tree was born,
Green, well-shaped, and full of charm.
A good friend to children, it stands so bright,
Bringing us joy and festive delight.
With ornaments and lights aglow,
It welcomes the season with a cheerful show.
Oh, Christmas tree, your beauty we admire,
A symbol of love that will never tire."
